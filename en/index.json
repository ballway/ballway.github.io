UTF-8 BOM adds a header to UTF-8, providing an extra marker in the file. This marker allows text editors to recognize whether the file is encoded as UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32. Without the BOM, a text editor has to scan the content upon opening a file to guess its encoding. However, the result of this guesswork may not always be accurate. Therefore, choosing UTF8-BOM directly eliminates the risk of the editor guessing incorrectly.
